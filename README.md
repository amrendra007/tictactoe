# Tic-Tac-Toe
As a part of learning Javascript, i have created this project.
Its a popular tic-tac-toe game, taking observation of how game 
works i have made this game **unbeatable**.

### Algorithm 

First turn is given to human(x) player then system(0) takes its turn.

Before taking any move, system always check for two adjacent 0 on board and if its find one it will mark 0 there.
I call this system attacking strategy to take over the game.

If attacking is not the case then system will check for two adjacent x on board and in case if its find such pair
it will mark 0 there, i call this system defending strategy.

And in rest cases, system will take some intelligent move according to how user is playing
